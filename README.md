_This is for the general populus that's like me and absolutely hates using the Slack Block Kit Builder GUI_.

## Foreward
_Ignore the fact that I'm writing this like a book, I'm new at coding... forgive me._

This is my first attempt at coding ever, and not going to lie - I built this by working with Claude 3.7 - we'll see how long it takes for me to date myself. Even with the utilization of an AI solution, this was a bit of a struggle for a first attempt. Prior to kicking this off at I think 3:20 AM ET, I didn't know much about React, I didn't know much about JS, and I new very little about GitHub. Now I'm kind of __dangerous__! :) 

## Goals for the Future
I hope this becomes something that I continue to build and eventually share with the larger community of Slack business users that want a GUI to make the overall Slack platform a bit more pretty, I mean really Slack/SFDC, is it too much to ask for WYSIWYG? Low form Markdown is a bit sad in this stage of the game! 

I also plan to document and share the heck out of this journey as this took something that has been soul crushingly low on my list of things to learn and made it into something that I'm __soooo__ hyped for.
